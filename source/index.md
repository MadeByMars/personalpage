I'm Haojun Ma, a Ph.D. candidate at [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) working with [Prof. Manos Kapritsos](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~manosk/index.html). In 2017, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree from [ACM Hornered Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research involves formal methods and distributed systems. I'm making formal verification of distributed systems more automatic. Now, we can verify [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) semi-automatically. You can also check my [CV](/file/CV.pdf).
